<section class="topic"><h2>What is WildFly 8 ?</h2><ul class="incremental"><li>Previously called “JBoss Application Server”</li><li>Upstream for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (JBoss EAP)</li><li>Fast, lightweight, manageable</li><li>Developer friendly</li><li>Supports Java EE standards and beyond</li><li>Open source</li></ul>
<details><details open=""><summary>Notes</summary><ul><li>The new name is relevant because it differentiates our community project from the commercial offering. After JBoss AS 7.1.2,the community offering is renamed to WildFly. This is the upstream project for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform. Main focus of WildFly is to meet community demands by rapid releases and latest in innovation. EAP is focused towards a more conservative branch, which is battle-tested for mission critical deployments.</li><li>WildFly provides a lightweight managed application runtime. WildFly provides a unified management layer fully integrated with all aspects of server and is exposed using a variety of APIs and protocols. These could be used to automate operational needs of any environment – small JVM on a tiny server or thousands of JVM spread across the world.</li><li>For JBoss, developer is the key. So from the very beginning WildFly is designed to be easy and quick to get going. It offers rapid boot time, excellent developer tooling through not just JBoss Tools project and NetBeans plugin but also community–contributed IntelliJ, and a wide variety of quick start examples.</li><li>WildFly implements the latest Java EE standards as well as additional open source innovative APIs. While Java EE is the most common usage of WildFly but it is not tied to any particular language or SDK. For example, TorqueBox provides full Ruby-on-Rails experience and is based on WildFly architecture and use many of its core features.</li><li>The source code is completely open source and available to you for free. If you have an issue with your application, you can attach a debugger and find out what might be causing the issue. You can file a bug, and then send a pull request for the patch to be applied.</li></ul></details></details></section>

This allows users to be restricted to specific areas of console such as to deploy an application or access privileged resources. This is commonly called as Role Based Administration Control (RBAC).</li><li>Also a special audit log with actions of the user is enabled and this log can then be uploaded to a secure location.</li><li>Automated patching ?</li></ul></details></details></section>

For JBoss AS 7.x or JBoss EAP 6.0 and 6.1, the web-based administrative console had an all-or-nothing approach. So if a user can authenticate with management security realm, then he&#8217;ll have all the privileges. This might be OK for smaller deployments but the roles are typically divided for mission critical deployments and a finer-grained control is required.</li><li>JBoss EAP 6.2 and WildFly 8 introduces RBAC using different roles. There are essential 7 different roles in 2 different categories – administrative and privileged.</li><li>Each Role is defined as a set of Permissions and Permissions specify what Actions are permitted by the logged in user, which is basically lookup, write, or delete.</li></ul></details></details></section>

Hibernate Search indexes objects for fast full-text searching. Multiple data sources are supported including Infinispan and standard database entities.</li><li>WildFly now provides a specialized Java security manager that allows you to define per-deployment security permissions, and also greatly improves upon the performance of using the standard Java security manager. In addition to the standard Java EE permissions.xml, a more flexible jboss-permissions.xml descriptor is also supported.</li><li>Allows applications to view cluster topology and listen for topology changes. Allows applications to broadcast/submit commands to nodes in the cluster for remote execution. Requisite modules are automatically made available to deployments, if supported by the server profile.</li><li>CMP - JPA offers much more performant and flexible API. JAX-RPC - JAX-WS offers a much more accurate and complete solution. JSR-88 - Very little adoptionr. Most preferred the more complete deployment APIs provided by venders. We decided to completely remove support for these technologies due to the high maintenance cost, low community interest, and much better alternative solutions. If you are not able to port at this time, we recommend looking at JBoss EAP6, which provides long term maintenance and support of these technologies.</li></ul></details></details></section>

<section class="topic source"><h2>Standalone and Managed Domain</h2><ul class="incremental"><li><strong>Standalone</strong>: single independent instance</li><li><strong>Managed domain</strong>: manage multiple WildFly instances from a single control point<ul><li>HA from fail-over: removes single point of failure</li><li>HA from load-balancing: timely response to client, even with high-volume requests</li></ul></li></ul>
<details><details open=""><summary>Notes</summary><ul><li>Standalone instance is a single independent instance of server, just like AS 4, 5, and 6. can be started using <code>bin/standalone.sh|bat</code> scripts.<ul><li>This mode is recommended for development.</li><li>If more than one standalone instance is launched and multi-server management is desired, it is the user&#8217;s responsibility to coordinate management across the servers. For example, to deploy an application across all of the standalone servers, the user would need to individually deploy the application on each server.</li></ul></li><li>A managed domain that allows you to run and manage a multi-server topology and manage multiple WildFly instances from a single control point. It can be started using <code>bin/domain.sh|bat</code> scripts.<ul><li>This mode is recommended for production.</li></ul></li><li>Deploying critical applications on a single node suffers from two potential problems:<ul><li>loss of application availability when the node hosting the application crashes (single point of failure)</li><li>loss of application availability in the form of extreme delays in response time during high volumes of requests (overwhelmed server)
WildFly supports two features which ensure high availability of critical Java EE applications:</li><li>fail-over: allows a client interacting with a Java EE application to have uninterrupted access to that application, even in the presence of node failures</li><li>load balancing: allows a client to have timely responses from the application, even in the presence of high-volumes of requests</li></ul></li><li>Fail-over allows a client interacting with a Java EE application to have uninterrupted access to that application, even in the presence of node failures. If the application makes use of WildFly&#8217;s fail-over services, a client interacting with an instance of that application will not be interrupted even when the node on which that instance executes crashes. Behind the scenes, WildFly makes sure that all of the user data that the application make use of (HTTP session data, EJB SFSB sessions, EJB entities and SSO credentials) are available at other nodes in the cluster, so that when a failure occurs and the client is redirected to that new node for continuation of processing (i.e. the client "fails over" to the new node), the users data is available and processing can continue.</li><li>Load balancing allow a client to have timely responses from the application, even in the presence of high-volumes of requests. Using a load balancer as a front-end, each incoming HTTP request can be directed to one node in the cluster for processing. in this way, the cluster acts as a pool of processing nodes and the load is "balanced" over the pool of nodes, achieving scalability and, as a consequence, availability.</li></ul></details></details></section>
<section class="topic source"><h2>Managed Domain</h2><img src="images/managed-domain.png" alt="managed domain">
<details><details open=""><summary>Notes</summary><ul><li>Domains can span multiple physical (or virtual) machines, with all WildFly 8 instances on a given host under the control of a special Host Controller process. One Host Controller instance is configured to act as the central Domain Controller. The Host Controller on each host interacts with the Domain Controller to control the lifecycle of the application server instances running on its host and to assist the Domain Controller in managing them.</li><li>Host controller (HC) is started with domain.sh|bat script and is only concerned with server management on that host. Domain Controller (DC) is a special HC that is configured to be the central management control point for the collection of servers in the ‘domain’.</li><li>All of the WildFly 8 instances in the domain share a common management policy, with the Domain Controller acting to ensure that each server is configured according to that policy.</li><li>A server group is set of server instances that will be managed and configured as one. In a managed domain each application server instance is a member of a server group. DC and HC ensures that all servers in a server group have a consistent configuration.</li><li>Server is an actual server instance. It runs in a separate JVM process from HC and is started by HC. User cannot launch this process from command line.</li><li>It&#8217;s important to understand that the choice between a managed domain and standalone servers is all about how your servers are managed, not what capabilities they have to service end user requests. This distinction is particularly important when it comes to high availability clusters. It&#8217;s important to understand that HA functionality is orthogonal to running standalone servers or a managed domain. That is, a group of standalone servers can be configured to form an HA cluster.</li></ul></details></details></section>

In this situation, you can add the TCPPING protocol stack to your configuration and use it as the default mechanism. These configuration options are available in the command-line based Management CLI. The mod_cluster subsystem also uses UDP communication by default, and you can choose to use TCP here as well.</li><li>Advantages of mod_cluster<ul><li>mod_cluster Management Protocol (MCMP) is an additional connection between the application server nodes and httpd, used by application server nodes to transmit server-side load balance factors and lifecycle events back to the web container via a custom set of HTTP methods.</li><li>Dynamic configuration of HTTPD proxies allows JBoss EAP 6 to adapt on the fly, with no additional configuration.</li><li>The application servers perform the load-balancing factor calculations.
